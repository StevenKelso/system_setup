# system_setup.sh

## About
A script to be used after a fresh install to install and set up programs which I consider essential to my workflow, regardless of distro or package manager.

Any programs which are unable to be installed, will be logged and listed to the user for manual installation.

## Usage

- Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/StevenKelso/system_setup
```

- cd into the directory
```bash
cd system_setup
```

```bash

```

- Run the script
```bash
